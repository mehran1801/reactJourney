Every component has something called props.

A componentâ€™s props is an object. It holds information about that component.




props makes React so useful. it makes the component reuseable, imagine we have a product and that product would have name, price and description. 

we will write the component once and we will use it several times by simply changing the props we provide to it.
This would render out the desired outcome that we want.

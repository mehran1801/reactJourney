# Congratulations I did it by myself...

I was always thinking about dynamic array and static array. 

I used static array and rendered buttons and then I just focused on dynamic array the whole time, picturing in my head what's happening with it. 


It will be changed on user's interaction, like data will be added and data will be removed. 


I thought hard how I am gonna use includes and filter as I learned in GroceryCart.js. 


! Bang operator is crucial. 

Good Luck.

# React functional component destructuring

i know how I was destructuring event object in eventHandler functions, but I found some confusing destructuring in functional components. so I am looking up online and try to clarify this.


# As per docs 

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen.

if the value is other than string use curly braces.
